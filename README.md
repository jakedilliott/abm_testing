# Agent Based Model Testing 
---
The point of this repo is to have a place to test out ABM in R. 

The journey begins with the article and code written by Sherry Towers which can be found [Here](http://sherrytowers.com/2012/12/12/neiu-lecture-v-stochastic-epidemic-modelling-with-agent-based-models/)

## Tasks
-[ ] Get the Sherry Towers script to run locally
-[ ] Change the inputs/equations of the script to explore outputs
-[ ] Add Exposed class to the script to make it an SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered)
-[ ] Long term, add Asymptomatic and Quarantined classes (SEIR + AQ Model)
